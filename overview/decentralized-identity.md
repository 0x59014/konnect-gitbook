# âœ¨ Decentralized Identity

Decentralized identity is a new way to manage your online identity, allowing you to take control of how it's expressed. It doesn't rely on traditional gatekeepers (like Facebooks and Twitters) to manage and verify your identity. You have the power to manage it yourself.

This approach flips the traditional model of data sharing on its head. Instead of users having to ask permission from platforms to share their information, now those platforms have to ask permission from users. This doesn't just change the power dynamic, it opens up new possibilities for a digital identity economy.

Using decentralized identity, businesses can create new use cases and solutions that weren't possible with traditional identity systems. This can lead to a more secure, more democratic, and more user-centric online ecosystem.

Decentralized identity is a constantly evolving field, and there is still no consensus on the complete list of necessary components. However, to fully understand the subject, we have compiled a list of terms that you should study.

### KonnectID (KIDs)

KIDs are a way to identify yourself online without using a central authority. They are globally unique, permanent, and verifiable identifiers that can be stored on a blockchain and they are the foundation of Web3 identity.

With a KID, you can prove who you are online without having to give your personal information to a bunch of different websites or apps. It's like a digital version of a driver's license that can only be used by the person it's issued to.

Web3 applications can use your KID to confirm that you are who you say you are. This means that you have more control over your personal information and who has access to it. KIDs can be used in various Web3 applications like decentralized marketplaces, social networks, and other platforms that require user identity verification.

### Web3 Credentials

Web3 credentials are an updated version of traditional credentials. What sets them apart is that they are not governed by centralized authorities and are instead distributed through a different channel, which is known as the Web3 medium. Specifically, these credentials take the form of tokens rather than through a more centralized system. There are two mediums in our case: SoulBound Tokens (SBTs) and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs).

#### **Soulbound Tokens (SBTs)**

SBTs are a unique type of verified claim that involves one public identifier making a claim about another decentralized public identifier. This claim can be seen as a reputation score, similar to a credit score, but the main difference is that the claim is permanent and visible to everyone. This makes it easier for verifiers to confirm, which is especially useful when granting voting rights in governance protocols. However, SBTs are non-transferable, which means that any negative claims made about an identifier will remain on that identifier as long as it exists. This makes it important to carefully consider the information included in SBTs, as any undesirable claims will be public for everyone to see.

#### Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)

NFTs are digital assets that are unique and cannot be exchanged for other tokens on a one-to-one basis. Unlike SBTs, NFTs can be transferred from one owner to another. They can be used in various ways, such as proving ownership of a specific item or showing attendance to an event, and can also serve as a creative medium for artists. NFTs are publicly visible and transparent, enabling the world to see and verify the authenticity of the claims made through them.

### Zero-knowledge Proofs

Zero-knowledge proofs offer a powerful tool for balancing privacy and security concerns. They enable individuals to maintain control over their personal information while still being able to verify their identity or make claims when necessary. By using this technology, users can have greater confidence in their online interactions and transactions, knowing that their personal information is being kept safe and secure.
