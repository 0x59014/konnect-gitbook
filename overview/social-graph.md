# ðŸ’ž Social Graph

While the social graph of Web 2.0 may seem harmless, it can actually threaten our personal privacy. Most social media companies track our activity and gather our personal data, which they then sell to third parties in order to make a profit. This can be a serious concern for individuals who want to keep their private information safe and secure.

Social media platforms capture and aggregate the social interactions and activities of users, which are monetized by the company. However, the users have limited control or ownership over their data and how it is used. Their rights are confined to using the social media platform for connecting and sharing with others, without any real say in how their data is used or how the platform is operated.

### Guide to Konnect Protocol

The primary goal of the web3 introduction is to prioritize decentralization and enable data ownership rights to the users.

Konnect Protocol is a social graph protocol that is decentralized and based on smart contracts. It allows users to own their social identities, connections, and content on a social network. Additionally, the protocol provides a social data layer which can be used by developers to compose social features for their applications.

Konnect Protocol eliminates the chances of data barriers and thresholds among social platforms. If users need to change the present social platform they are using, they can shift the user identity with all on-chain history to other platforms without any hitches.
